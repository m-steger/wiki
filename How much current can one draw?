An easy rule-of-thumb for determining the slow/intermediate/fast rates for charging/discharging a rechargeable chemical battery, mostly independent of the actual manufacturing technology: lead acid, NiCd, NiMH, Li...

We will call C (unitless) to the numerical value of the capacity of our battery, measured in A.h (Ampere-hour).
In your question, the capacity of the battery is 2.4Ah, hence, C=2.4 (unitless).
Most of the batteries in the market will happily charge/discharge at a rate of less than 1C Amperes.
In an ideal world, this would translate into a 1 hour charge/discharge process. In practice, the charging/discharging process may require/reduce up to twice/half the time.
Without further information (datasheet), I would personally not charge/discharge any battery at a rate higher than 1C, for safety and endurance reasons.
In your question, less than 2.4A would be a nice charge/discharge rate, as the manufacturer datasheet confirms.
By applying a charge/discharge rate much less than 1C, for instance, <0.1C, you may considerably extend the life of a chemical battery.
Rates << 1C are commonly known as "Slow" rates: 0.5C, 0.2C, 0.1C...
Charge/discharge rates higher than 1C are best avoided unless working with a properly known battery.
Rates >> 1C rates are commonly known as "Fast" rates: 2C, 3C...
In the past, batteries designed for rates >1C were usually marketed as "high current" batteries, because not all batteries were capable of sustaining such rates safely or without compromising its endurance.
Nowadays, most batteries can safely be used at rates >1C, up to the rating specified by the manufacturer. However, a reduction in the battery life is surely expected.
Forcing a battery to rates >5-10C involves serious risks.
Disclaimer: this is a simple rule-of-thumb, useful as an starting point, when the datasheet is not available or when dealing with a no-brand/unknown battery.
